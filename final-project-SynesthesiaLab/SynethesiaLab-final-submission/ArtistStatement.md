## Synesthesia Lab - Artist Statement

Synesthesia Lab, also known as The Soundboard, is a hybrid soundboard that merges physical interaction and digital feedback, allowing users to explore sound through both touch, sound and, sight. Each button triggers a unique sound and a corresponding visual animation, creating a playful and immersive audiovisual experience.

Inspired by synesthesia, interactive art like Reactable, and the bold aesthetics of 90s arcade carpets, our goal was to turn sound into something you could also see. The project invites curiosity, users are encouraged to experiment, layer sounds, and discover new combinations through open-ended play. 

We built a physical interface using a Micro:bit and custom buttons, navigating challenges around input limitations and pin configurations. Many pins had default display functions, which required problem-solving to override and repurpose them. Getting the sound and visuals to respond in sync through both the microcontroller and keyboard input involved a lot of testing and troubleshooting.

Despite technical hurdles, we succeeded in creating an interactive, evolving artwork. The project taught us the importance of planning buffer time and adapting on the fly. In the end, Synesthesia Lab became exactly what we envisioned: a playful space where users can experiment, express, and create.
